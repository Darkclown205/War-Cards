# Card Game App

A simple card game built using SwiftUI where the first player to score 10 points wins. The player and the AI each draw a card, and the one with the higher card value wins the round. The game continues until either the player or AI reaches 10 points.

## Features

- **Randomized Card Draws:** Each round, the player and AI draw a card with values ranging from 2 to 14.
- **Scoring System:** Scores are updated based on the card values drawn. The first to reach 10 points wins.
- **Winning Message:** A message is displayed announcing the winner when 10 points are reached.
- **Auto-Reset:** The game automatically resets after announcing the winner, ready for a new game.
